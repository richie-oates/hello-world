# hello-world
My first repository

I've been learning Unity for almost a month now and I'm completely dedicated to becoming a developer.
I've already completed the Unity Essentials Foundational Pathway as well as half of the 12 week Junior Unity Developer Pathway.

Before this I completed an Android(Java) Basics course with Udacity, also a WatchandCode tutorial on Javascript.
In the past I did the KhanAcademy Javascript courses and did some basic coding back in Uni so it's not all completely new to me.

I'm in the process of making a Space Invaders style game based on characters which my preschool kids created by hand.

Now I'm trying to get familiar with GitHub.
